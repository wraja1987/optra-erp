## AI Usage in Nexa

Nexa AI appears as a top bar and a right-side recommendations panel. It provides contextual hints without blocking flows. All calls are masked and audited.

Key points:
- Suggestions are mocked in stubs; production calls respect governance and token caps.
- “Why am I seeing this?” explains sources in a generic way without PII.

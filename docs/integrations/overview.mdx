## Overview
Integrations connect Optra to external tools. Admins enable and manage feeds/exports and the Shopify pilot. Staff may view status where permitted.

## How‑tos
1. Enable a feed: Go to Integrations → Feeds → Add → Save.
2. Schedule an export: Integrations → Exports → New → CSV → Confirm.
3. Connect Shopify: Integrations → Shopify Pilot → Connect → Enter API keys.
4. Test a webhook: Integrations → Feeds → Test → Verify 200.
5. Export orders: Exports → Sales Orders → CSV → Download.

## Troubleshooting
- Feed failing: Check credentials and endpoint availability.
- Export empty: Confirm date filters and permissions.
- Shopify sync slow: Reduce batch size and retry.
- 403 on settings: You need Admin or Superadmin.
- CSV garbled: Ensure UTF‑8 and correct delimiter.
